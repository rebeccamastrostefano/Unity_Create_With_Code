-> Intro

=== Intro ===

You wake up, tired and confused
You don't know where you are // He's on a spaceship
Everything is dark, except the starts outside the window. #start music #lights on
-> what

    = what
What do you want to do?

    *   Go by the window
    -> look_out
    
    *   Look Around
    ->look_around
    
    + Wait
    ->Wait
    
    =look_out
Out of the window there's only... space
You are floating in the middle of an endless abyss
      * Look around the room
      ->look_around
    
    =look_around
 The room is empty, there's only a bizarre machine dripping with thick water.
    * Go by the window
    ->look_out
    * Analyse the machine
    ->machine
    
    
    =machine
It looks like a big distiller, that liquid is not water
Maybe blood... but not human blood
->voice

    =Wait
You wait and rest
    *   Go by the window
    -> look_out
    
    *   Look Around
    ->look_around
    
    + Wait
    ->Wait
    
    =voice
Suddenly you hear a voice...
-> END
